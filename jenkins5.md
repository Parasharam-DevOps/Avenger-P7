  }
}
job('devops-01') {

  }
}
job('devops-02') {
  steps {
    shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
  }
}
job('devops-03') {
  steps {
    shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
  }
}
job('dev-01') {
  steps {
    shell('echo -e "$JOB_NAME is running... \n Buid No.- $BUILD_NUMBER"')
  }
}
job('dev-02') {
